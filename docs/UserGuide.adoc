=== Detecting Clashes :

When the user inputs a new event, MisterMusik will check
if it has any clashing date and time with existing events
and warns the user of the clash. This also detects clashes
when recurring events are entered, so there is no need
to manually check for schedule clashes.

=== Sorting By Date :

MisterMusik will automatically sort the list by the date and time of each task
so the user will not have to manually prioritise each event and todo task. ToDos
are listed at the front of each day as they do not have an included time.
