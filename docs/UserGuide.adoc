== Additional Features

=== Detecting Clashes :

When the user inputs a new event, MisterMusik will check
if it has any clashing date and time with existing events
and warns the user of the clash. This also detects clashes
when recurring events are entered, so there is no need
to manually check for schedule clashes.

=== Sorting By Date :

MisterMusik will automatically sort the list by the date and time of each task
so the user will not have to manually prioritise each event and todo task. ToDos
are listed at the front of each day as they do not have an included time.

=== Budget handling system ：

The system allows for the user to handle their own monthly budget. There is a set budget
for each month (fixed at $50 initially) that stops users from entering new concerts into
the schedule if that new concert would cause the costs of concerts for the month to exceed
the stipulated budget.

For example, if the list contains a concert on the 4th of July, 2019 that costs $49,
entering a new concert that costs more than a dollar would causes the system to cancel the
operation as it would lead to monthly costs of $51 that exceeds the monthly budget of $50.

The user also has the ability to change the stipulated budget for each month or universally if
he/she wishes to (Coming in v1.4).

=== Reminder for specific task types : `[coming v2.0]`

The user will be able to get reminders of specific task type using the reminder command
and specifying which type they would like to be displayed. +

E.g. “reminder exam”
displays a reminder of all exam events within the next 3 days.
