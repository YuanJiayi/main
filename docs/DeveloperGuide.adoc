By: `Team CS2113T-F11-4`      Since: `Aug 2019`      Licence: `MIT`


== Setting up
=== Prerequisites
. *JDK 11* or above is required
. *IntelliJ* IDE is recommended
[NOTE]
IntelliJ by default has Gradle plugin installed. +
 Do not disable them. If you have disabled them, go to `File` > `Settings` > `Plugins` to re-enable them.

=== Setting up the project environment on your local machine
. Fork and clone the forked remote on your local machine
. Launch IntelliJ (If you’re not on the IntelliJ Welcome screen please close your existing project by going to `File` >
`Close Project`)
. Set up the correct JDK version for Gradle
.. Click `Configure` > `Structure for New Projects`
.. Under `Project Settings` Click on `Project`
.. Under `Project SDK` Click `New…` and point it to JDK 11 path
.. Click `OK` to save the configuration
. Click `Import Project`
. Locate the `build.gradle` file and select it. Click `Open`
. Open the IntelliJ console/terminal and run the gradle command `gradlew processResource` on *Windows* or
`./gradlew processResource` on *Mac/Linux* (If you are encountered a permission error: `./gradlew: Permission denied`
add the executable permission to the the shell script by running `chmod 744 gradlew` in your terminal) It should finish
with the `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message. This will generate the resources required by the application and tests.

=== Verifying the setup
. Run MisterMusik to verify and try a few commands.
. Run the JUNIT Test/gradlew test command to ensure that all the test case passes.

== Design
=== Overall Architecture
This image shows the overall architecture of our program

image::Architecture main.png[width = 500%]

=== Main component
Main component has one class called `Duke`. It is responsible for the following: +

. On startup: Initializes all components and sets up the correct file path so that the program correctly interacts
with the external txt file.
. During runtime: Acts as an intermediary between the `Parser` class and the `Command` so that user input can be parsed
and then executed accordingly.
. On shutdown: Interacts with the UI class to communicate the shutdown message to the user.

=== UI component
UI component contains all classes necessary to interact successfully with the user. The `Parser` parses input commands
from the user whilst the `UI` class handles all necessary dissemination of information to the user through `System.out`.

=== Logic component
This component contains all necessary classes that :

. Are in charge of handling how all necessary information is internally stored within the program's runtime.
. Alter the internally stored information whenever necessary (i.e when changes are made by the user).
. Extract information requested by the user from the stored information and pass them back to the user through the UI
component
. This is achieved through the two classes `EventList` and `Command`. `EventList` decides how information is stored
internally as well as how internal stored information is altered and/or extracted. `Command` commands the `EventList`
class on what needs to be done at any point in time.

=== Storage component
This component contains all necessary classes that read and write external txt files. This is where all information is
stored while the program is not running. +
In particular, the `Storage` class directly reads from and writes to and external txt file in the data directory.

=== Commons
This component represent all other low-level classes required for the program to function. +
This includes classes like the `Event` class which is the abstract parent class for all the types of classes that
represent the different types of events(`ToDo`, `Concert`, `Exam`, etc.) a user can input as an entry in the program.

This image shows the sequence diagram when a user input "delete 1" is entered.

== Implementation
This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

=== Calendar Table
The calendar table is generated from the `EventList`. It prints on the screen a table of calendar of 7 days
starting from a specified day, including the events within this time period. +

==== Sequence diagram
Below is the sequence diagram of calendarView.

image::calendar_sequenceDiagram.png[width = "800"]

==== How it is implemented
Given below is the sequential steps of how a calendar table is generated and printed.

Step 1. User enters `calendar` to start the initialization process of a calendar table with today as the starting day.

Step 2. The program checks the date of the given start day to generate a list of 7 days, starting from given day.
It also gets the day of the 7 days (e.g. Monday, Tuesday, etc). This sets the dates info of the table.

E.g. Example of a day and dates list

image::DGCalendarTableDaysList.png[width = "600"]

Step 3. The program find all events in the `EventList` that is within the 7 days,
and store them correspondingly into 7 queues, representing the 7 days. This is for further printing.

E.g. Example of an event list of 7 days

image::DGCalendarTableExample.png[width = "600"]

Step 4. The program now have all the information of these 7 days and is then able to print the calendar table.

. It initiates an empty string to store all info of the calendar and for later printing.
. It puts the header of he table into the string.
. It puts the days of week and dates info into the string.
. To add in events, each event takes 3 rows (time info, description, and dashes) to print. For each 3 rows,
there can be at most 7 events. The events are added per 3 rows. For each 3 rows, the program creates an array of 3 * 7
to store the details. Whenever there exists an event at the position of a day, details of the event will be added to
the corresponding 3 rows (1 column) of the array. The array is then added by rows into the string.

E.g. Example of a row of events stored for printing

image::DGCalendarTableRow.png[width = "600"]

==== Commands for CalendarView
- `calendar` This prints the calendar table of this 7 days.
- `calendar next` This prints the calendar table of the next 7 days.
- `calendar last` This prints the calendar table of the last 7 days.
- `calendar on` Allow the calendar to be printed after every command execution.
- `calendar off` Not allowing the calendar to be printed after every command execution.

=== Check Free Days
CheckFreeDays is a command that allows the program to search for the next 3 days without any
events (except ToDos). +

. When the user enters `check`, starting from the current day, the program
checks all the events whether any is in this day.
. If not, this day will be added into a list.
. Above process will continue until the list has 3 days, which will then be printed.

The following activity diagram shows how check free days is implemented.

image::check_activityDiagram.png[width = "800"]

=== Checklists
Checklist of each event can be used to remind users of certain items (e.g. bring glasses to concert).
This is implemented by storing an array list of strings in `Event` objects.

Checklist implementation contains 4 operations:

==== add checklist item
`checklist add <event index>/<checklist item>`
This adds an item into a specific event's checklist.

==== view checklist
`checklist view <event index>`
This prints on the screen the checklist of an event.

==== edit checklist item
`checklist edit <event index> <item index>/<new item>`
This edits a specific item in the checklist of an event.

==== delete checklist item
`checklist delete <event index> <item index>`
This deletes an item from the checklist of an event.

=== Clash handling
==== Activity diagram
The following activity diagram represents a typical clash handling scenario

image::Activity Diagram Clash handling.png[Clash Handling, 1600, align=center]

==== How is it implemented
The program is able to *detect clashes when creating new events*. When the user enters the command
to add a new Event entry to the list, the method `EventList.addEvent` is called from the `Command`
class object upon execution.

The `addEvent` method will then call the `EventList.clashEvent` method to check the
existing entries for any clash in schedule. This is done by first searching the list for an event
that has a matching date with the new event.

If no such event is found, the method returns a *_null_* value, indicating that there is no schedule clash.
If an event is found with a matching date, the `clashEvent` then calls the `EventList.timeClash` method to check whether
the two events have overlapping time periods.

If there is any overlap, the `timeClash` method will return *_true_* as a boolean, indicating there is a schedule clash.
The `clashEvent` method then throws an exception `ClashException`, indicating that there was indeed a schedule
clash between the desired new entry and some pre-existing Event.

The details of the clashing Event are passed back to `Command` object via the exception so that it can be used to inform the
user about the clashing event. The user is then required to fix the conflict before continuing,
either by rescheduling or deleting the pre-existing event, or by choosing a different date/time for
the new Event entry.

==== Why it is implemented this way
The process of checking for a clash was implemented as small, simple components so as to ensure scalability,
reliability, and to reduce dependencies.

The choice to use exception handling to deal with an event clash
was done so that it could be easily re-purposed for any incremental extension that required checking for a
schedule clash. Catching of the ClashException should be performed in the Command class, and the info regarding the
schedule clash can be easily obtained for further action.

By having the `clashEvent` method return a *_null_* value or a reference to a clashing event in the schedule, the
`clashEvent` method can now be used for any further increments to the code requiring addition of events.

It was thus easy to implement this clash detection as a part of adding recurrent events
(to check for clashes when recurrent events were automatically entered) as well as the
rescheduling function (to check for clashes when the user attempts to reschedule
an existing event, so that he/she does not inadvertently create a new schedule conflict).

This implementation is reliable because it can always be expected to work whenever it is necessary to add
new events to the list, provided the unit tests for this functionality under MainTest work. It is also not
dependent on any other functionality, allowing for developers to change the implementation of other parts of the
application without affecting the clash handling

==== Expected behaviour of functionality
When a user attempts to add an event(recurring or otherwise) and the program detects a clash with an existing event
in the pre-existing list, the following output should be printed: +

    "That event clashes with another in the schedule! Please resolve the conflict and try again!"

This is followed by the following line indicating the details of the detected clash: +

    "Clashes with: [E][X] YST Final project review START: Tue, 03 Dec 2019, 15:00 END: Tue, 03 Dec 2019, 18:00

==== Design considerations
While designing the clash handling system, i had to decide how best to: +
1. Detect a clash. +
2. Pass relevant information back to the caller class for further usage. +

|=========================================================
|Aspect |Alternative 1 |Alternative 2

|How clashes were detected |
Simple if-else statements instead of using exception handling. +

Pros: Much easier to implement and simpler to work with. +

Cons: Less scalability as it would be harder to integrate the functionality into new features.|
Have a specific command/method so that the current list can be checked for a clash at will.

Pros: Much more flexible, and even more scalable than the current implementation as it would be possible
to do anything regarding changes to the list, and then later check for clashes.

Cons: Much more room for error, since clashes are allowed to exist within the list normally, and are not
automatically detected. This could lead to major bugs related to events that overlap each other.

|How relevant information is passed up the chain|
Simply returning the relevant event that caused the clash as a part of the method call. +

Pros: Extremely simple to understand. Easy to implement. No need to deal with exception handling, just
code for specific case in the event of a clash. +

Cons: Less scalable. If a developer wants to add more functionality to the clash handling(e.g return more data), he/she
would need to return a new object containing the relevant data.|
|=========================================================

=== Add recurring events
==== Activity diagram
The following is the activity diagram for adding recurring events.

image::recurringEventActivityDiagram.png[with="800", align = center]

==== How it is implemented
The program is able to detect recurring events and their periods when creating new events.
When the user enters the command to add a new `Lesson` or `Practice` event with a period (in days) followed,
`createNewEvent` method will call `entryForEvent` to get the period. +
If the new event is not a recurring event, the period value will be assigned to `NON-PERIOD` and then call the
`addEvent` method in the `EventList` class.

After getting the period, the `createNewEvent` method will call the `addRecurringEvent` method in the `EventList` class
to create and store new events in the eventList. +
The calculation of dates are done by Java Calendar, `Calendar.add` function is called to calculate the startDate
and endDate of new events in `Java Date type`. The number of recurring events is depended on the period, since the
maximum date between the first recurring event and the last one is up to `ONE_SEMESTER_DAYS` which is assigned to
16 weeks (112 days) now. +
When creating the `startEventDate` and `endEventDate` of the new event,
`calendar.getTime` is called and the `identifier` in EventDate will be assigned to `DATE_TO_STRING`, so that the
`startDateAndTime` and `endDateAndTime` are in `String type`, which fits the requirement of the `Event` class.

All the events created in the `addRecurringEvent` method will be checked whether having clash with the events in the
current eventList and then added in a temporary event list one by one. If no clash happens, the `tempEventList` will
be added to the current `eventList`.

Given below is an example usage scenario compared to adding non-recurring event. +
Recurring event: `lesson|practice` <event description> /dd-MM-yyyy HHmm HHmm `/<period(in days)>` +
Non-recurring event: <event type> <event description> /dd-MM-yyyy HHmm HHmm

==== Why it is implemented this way
. Whether the input command has a period is considered at the first, so that the dependency between adding
recurrent events and adding normal events could be reduced.
. The `add(int field, int amount)` method of `Calendar` class is used to add or subtract from the given calendar field
and a specific amount of time, based on the calendar's rules. +
`public abstract void add(int _field_, int _amount_)`
. Since the number of recurrent events with a short period could be large, it is more likely to have clashes with the
current eventList. Hence, before added in the temporary event list, the new event need to be ensured that no clash
happens.
. To keep the format of creating new events, the format process of changing Java Date to String is done in the
`EventDate` class instead of messing the `Event` class to accept both Date and String types as input date and time.

==== Sequence diagram
The following sequence diagram shows how the adding recurring event operation works.

image::recurringEventSequenceDiagram.png[width="800", align = center]

==== Design considerations
Aspect: How to avoid adding infinite events +

* *Alternative 1 (current choice):* Set a upper limit to ensure the interval between the first and last events added to
list is not too long.
** Pros: Easy to implement. Easy to add lesson and practice in one semester.
** Cons: Not agility. May add too many extra events if users want short interval between the first and last
recurring events.
* *Alternative 2:* Let users to set the interval between the first and last recurring events.
** Pros: Will be more agility and user friendly.
** Cons: Hard to unify the command format.

=== Contacts list
==== How is it implemented
The contacts list stores a list of contacts contain <name>, <email address>, and <phone number> information added by
users. The list is stored in each individual event. When the user first creates the event, the event is created with an
empty contact list. +
*Users can add, edit, delete a specified contact item, and view the contacts list of a specified event.*

===== Adding a contact
====
Given below is an example to adding a contact: +
`contact add <event number> /<name>, <email address>, <phone number>`
====
.. When the command is entered, the manageContacts() method will be called.
.. The method will check whether the event ID is valid. Add a new Contact will be created with contact information in it.
.. The event corresponding to the ID entered along with its method addContact() will be called to add the contact into
the contact list in the event.
.. The printContactAdded() method of the UI class will be called to reflect the change to the user.

===== Viewing the contact list
====
Given below is an example to view contact list of an event: +
`contact view <event number>`
====
.. When the command is entered, the manageContacts() method will be called.
.. The method will check whether the event ID is valid, and whether the contact list of the event is empty.
.. If the contact list is empty, printNoContactInEvent() will be called to inform the user that contact list is empty.
If the contact list is not empty, printEventContacts() will be called ang print all the contacts in the list under the event.

===== Editing a contact
====
Given below is an example to edit a contact in the contact list: +
`contact edit <event number> <contact number> name|email|phone /<new contact>`
====
.. When the command is entered, the manageContacts() method will be called.
.. The method will check whether the event ID, the contact ID, and the edit type are valid.
.. The contact information will be changed.
.. The printContactEdited() method of the UI class will be called to reflect the change to the user.

===== Deleting a contact
====
Given below is an example to delete a contact in the contact list: +
`contact delete <event number> <contact number>`
====
.. When the command is entered, the manageContacts() method will be called.
.. The method will check whether the event ID and the contact ID are valid.
.. The contact will be deleted from the list.
.. The printContactDeleted() method of the UI class will be called to reflect the change to the user.

==== Why is it implemented this way
. For different events, users may have different people to contact with. So a empty contact list is created under each
event. For some events, users may have more than one person to contact with. Hence, users are allowed add more contact
items under one event.
. We want to keep the information highly relative to contact, so users just need to add <name>, <email address>, and
<phone number> for a contact item. Sometimes may not have the email or phone number of a person, so it also allows users
to add one of <email address> and <phone number>.
. The main propose of MisterMusik is schedule events, so the contact list is hidden on the basic list viewing. Users can
use command `contact view <event number>` to see the contact list of the specified event.

=== Viewing specific dates
==== How is it implemented
The implementation is a simple for loop that runs through the existing task list. If a matching date is detected,
it will return the corresponding task and add it to a temporary list of found tasks. After running through the whole
list, the temporary list will be printed out to display all the tasks of a specific date.

Step 1: When the command "view <date>" is given, the viewEvents() method will be called.

Step 2: A temporary ArrayList is created by the method to be populated.

Step 3: The date string from the input command is passed into the EventDate class to be formatted into the same format as that of
each event and returned as a string.

Step 4: The returned string is compared with each task in the event list to check for any event with a matching date.

Step 5: When an event with a matching date is found, the event is added to the temporary list.

Step 6: After the entire list has been checked, the temporary list is passed into a UI instance

Step 7: The printFoundEvents() method will be called. The said method then prints out the temporary list, displaying the list of events taking place on a specific date.

In the situation when an empty temporary list is passed into the UI for it to print, an exception will occur and the
printFoundEvents() method will catch the exception before printing out a string to inform the user that there are no tasks
taking place on that specific date.

==== Activity Diagram
image::DGViewEventsDiagram.png[width = 100%]

==== Why is it implemented this way
The matching events are being stored individually into a separate temporary list before being printed out. This is to allow
an easier handling of individual tasks as separate instances in case the user wishes to edit a particular task from the
temporary list.

==== Alternative implementations considered
Storing all the matching events as a single string, passing the string into the printFoundEvents() method to print out. This
implementation is undesirable as it will be difficult to access individual matching events in the case the user wishes to edit
them as mentioned above.

==== Sequence Diagram
image::ViewScheduleSeqDiagram.png[]

=== Goals List
==== How is it implemented
The goals list is an array list type that stores a list of goals to be achieved by the user for each individual event, particularly
for Lesson and Practice type events. When the user first creates the event, the event is created with an empty goal list. Only
when the user types in "goal add <event ID>" then the goal list will be updated with the particular goal. The user can then
manipulate the goal list by using "goal edit", "goal delete" or "goal view" commands.

===== Adding a goal
Step 1: When the command "goal add <event ID>/<goal description>" is entered, the goalsManagement() method will be called.

Step 2: The command description will be split up into separate strings. The string for event ID will be parsed into an
integer type.

Step 3: The method will check the string for the goal command description. In this case it will be "add" and execute the
code for this case.

Step 4: A new Goal class instance will be created with the goal description string. Its achieved status set as false.

Step 5: The event corresponding to the ID entered along with its method addGoal() will be called to add the goal instance
into the goal list.

Step 6: The goalAdded() method of the UI class will be called to reflect the change to the user.

===== Editing a goal
Step 1: The user will enter the command "goal edit <event ID> <goal ID>/<new goal description>". The goalsManagement() method
is called.

Step 2: The command description will be split up into separate strings. The strings for event ID and goal ID will be parsed
into an integer type.

Step 3: The method will check the string for the goal command description. In this case it will be "edit" and execute the
code for this case.

Step 4: A new Goal class instance will be created for the new goal description.

Step 5: The method editGoalList() of the event corresponding to the input ID will be called. The method will set the goal indicated
as the new Goal instance.

Step 6: The goalUpdated() method of the UI class will be called to reflect the change to the user.

===== Deleting a goal
Step 1: When the user enters the command "goal delete <event ID> <goal ID>", the goalsManagement() method will be called.

Step 2: The command description will be split up into separate strings. The strings for event ID and goal ID will be parsed
into an integer type.

Step 3: The method will check the string for the goal command description. In this case it will be "delete" and execute the
code for this case.

Step 4: The corresponding event will have its removeGoal() method called which removes the indicated goal from the list.

Step 5: The goalDeleted() method of the UI class will be called to reflect the change to the user.

===== Setting the goal as achieved
Step 1: When the command "goal achieved <event ID> <goal ID>" is given, the goalsManagement() method will be called.

Step 2: The command description will be split up into separate strings. The strings for event ID and goal ID will be parsed
into an integer type.

Step 3: The method will check the string for the goal command description. In this case it will be "achieved" and execute the
code for this case.

Step 4: The method updateGoalAchieved() for the corresponding event will be called.

Step 5: The goals list within the event is called with the indicated goal.

Step 6: The indicated goal will then call its setAchieved() method that assigns the boolean isAchieved attribute of that
particular goal to "true".

Step 7: The goalSetAsAchieved() method of the UI class will be called to reflect the change to the user.

===== Viewing the goal list
Step 1: The user will enter the command "goal view <event ID>". The goalsManagement() method will be called.

Step 2: Command description will be split and the string for event ID will be parsed into an integer type.

Step 3: The printEventGoals() method will be called to check the contents of the goal list for the indicated event.

Step 4: If the goals list is not empty, it will print out the contents of the list using a for loop. Otherwise it will
print a message to the user to reflect that the goal list is empty.

==== Why is it implemented this way
The goal managing function is implemented as a separate list within an event in order to utilise the indexing of the list
elements. This way, a particular goal for a particular event can be easily accessed and manipulated via the input of an
integer.

==== Alternatives considered
An alternate method considered was to implement the goals list as a separate class of its own. Each goal within this list
will then be mapped to their corresponding events. This implementation method would cause difficulties on the users' part
in identifying the ID of a particular goal and would generally makes the goal list less organised.

==== Sequence Diagram
Below is a sequence diagram for the "goal delete" operation.
image:DeleteGoalSeq.png[]

=== Past event management
This functionality basically tracks which tasks in the list have already passed, and subsequently only displays future
tasks when the user uses the "list" command to view the list. This function is linked with the goals management function
as it also detects unachieved goals in events that are already over.

==== How is it implemented
The EventList class contains an integer attribute called currentDateIndex, which will be initialised to 0. The system will
then compare the current date with the start dates of each of the events in the event list. Once an event that is in the
future has been reached, the index of the event will be assigned to the currentDateIndex. After this has been done, the
"list" command will only list out events starting from that particular index.

Step 1: The integer attribute currentDateIndex in the EventList class instance will be initialised to 0 and the Date class
currentDate attribute will be initialised to the system date and time of that instance

Step 2: Whenever the user inputs the "list" command, the listOfEvents_String() method is called which will in turn call the
findNextEventAndSetBoolean() method which takes in the Date class that has been initialised in step 1.

Step 3: In the findNextEventAndSetBoolean() method, the start dates of each event are compared to the current date using
Date class's compareTo() method using a for loop.

Step 4: The moment the loop reaches an event that has not happened yet i.e. its start date is later than the current date,
the index of the event in the list will be assigned to the currentDateIndex and the loop terminates.

Step 5: Back in the listOfEvents_String() method, the list of events starting from the one with the same index integer as
currentDateIndex will be returned to the UI class to be printed out.

==== Why is it implemented this way
This function is implemented this way to maximise the usefulness of the indexing nature of ArrayList. Even if an
event has passed and the list no longer shows it, the indexes of all the events are kept constant. This is crucial as the
commands for most of our functions require the user to indicate the index of an event they want to manipulate, and keeping
them constant makes it very easy for the user to input commands without having to take note of the change in the event indexes
after making any changes to the list.

==== Alternatives considered
We have considered the possibility of deleting the past events that are over. However, as mentioned above we require the indexing
of the events to stay constant and by deleting the past events, the event indexes will change as well.

==== Integration with goal list management
===== Implementation
The management of goals list can be integrated with the ability to track past events. This is done through a boolean attribute
gotPastUnachieved in the EventList class. If true, there are unachieved goals for past events and vice versa.

Step 1: User enters the "list" command. The listOfEvents_String() method is called which then calls the findNextEventAndSetBoolean() method.

Step 1: Within the findNextEventAndSetBoolean() method, the attribute currentDateIndex is checked to see if it is more than 0. If it
is, that means there are past events.

Step 2: If there are past events, the method will enter a nest of two for loops. The outer loop runs through all the past events,
while the inner loop iterates through the goal list for each individual past event.

Step 3: Each time an inner loop is iterated through, the getBooleanStatus() method for the particular event will be called. If returns
true, gotPastUnachieved will be assigned as true and the method will break out of the loop.

Step 4: After the event list has been printed out, the method getPastEventsWithUnachievedGoals() is called. This method utilises two
nested for loops to identify the unachieved goals among all the past events and passes both the past events along with all their
unachieved goals to the UI class to be printed out below the event list.

=== Reminders

==== How it is implemented
The reminder function filters out the tasks that are due or are happening before 2359 an input number of days after 
the current date, and prints them out as a reminder for the users. If the number of days is not provided, the number
of days is 3 by default.

After the user enters 'reminder', the Command.execute method calls Command.remindEvents, which in turn calls the
Ui.printReminders function. The Ui.printReminders function calls the EventList.getReminder method, which uses the
EventList.filteredList method to filter out a list of events that are due or are happening before 2359 the input number 
of days after the current date. The EventList.filteredList method filters out events from the stored list of events
according to a certain input predicate.

The constructor of the Predicate class takes in two arguments: the reference and the comparator. The reference is the
item that is used for the comparison reference (comp) input, and the comparator is the operator that is used for the
comparison. The comparator should be either one of the three global integer variables: EQUAL, GREATER_THAN or SMALLER_THAN.
The Predicate.check method takes in an input and checks if reference (comp) input is true by calling the appropriate method
in the Predicate class depending on the type of the reference and input.

In the EventList.getReminder method, the reference of the input Predicate object is set to an eventDate object set to
2359 the input number of days after the current date, and the comparator is GREATER_THAN. After that, the EventList.getReminder 
method calls the EventList.filteredList method. In the EventList.filteredList method, the system iterates through the list of 
Events in `eventArrayList`.The EventDate object stored in the the Event object is passed into the Predicate.check method. If the
EventDate object stored in the the Event object is a date before the reference date, the Predicate.check method returns true
and the Event object is added to the output. After all the elements in EventList.filteredList are parsed and the
EventList.filteredList method terminates, EventList.getReminder method returns a string containing the current date and time,
the date and time at 2359 the input number of days after the current date, and the filtered list of events. This string is 
printed to stdout in the Ui.printReminders function.

==== Sequence diagram
The following sequence diagram shows how the reminder functionality works.
====
image::reminderSequenceDiagram.png[width = 100%]
====

==== Why it is implemented this way
The reminder function is split the various components into different methods for easier testing. In this case, Ui.printReminders
prints the output to the user interface, EventList.getReminder is responsible for compiling the output whereas EventList.filteredList
obtains the filtered list of events from `eventArrayList`.

This implementation also implements scalability as the Predicate class and the EventList.filteredList method can be reused for other
functions.

=== Instruments

==== How it is implemented
The mistermusik.commons.Instruments.InstrumentList class stores an array list of instruments. Instruments are objects of class
mistermusic.commons.Instruments.Instrument. Each instance of the mistermusic.commons.Instruments.Instrument class also has an 
array list of services. Services are objects of class mistermusic.commons.Instruments.Services.

==== Adding an instrument

Step 1: The user will type in the command `instrument add /<instrument name>`. The addInstrument() method from the InstrumentList 
class is called.

Step 2: The addInstrument() method creates a new instance of Instrument with the given input name. 

Step 3: The getInstrumentIndexAndName() method, which returns a string containing the index of the instrument and the name, is 
called. 

Step 4: The instrumentAdded() method from the Ui class is then called, which prints a message stating that the instrument has
been added.

==== Viewing the list of instruments stored in the system

Step 1: The user will type in the command `instrument view instruments`. The getInstruments() method from the InstrumentList 
class is called.

Step 2: The getInstruments() method returns a string containing a list of instruments stored in the InstrumentList instance used
for the program. 

Step 3: The printInstruments() method from the Ui class is then called, which prints out the list of instruments stored in the
InstrumentList instance used for the program.

==== Servicing an instrument

Step 1: The user will type in the command `instrument service <instrument index> /<brief description of servicing> /<date>`.
The service() method from the InstrumentList instance is called.

Step 2: The service() method of the InstrumentList instance calls the addService() method of the referenced Instrument stored in the
InstrumentList instance based on the input index. 

Step 3: The addService() method adds the relevant servicing information to the Instrument instance by creating a new ServiceInfo
instance and adding it to the array list of ServiceInfo stored in the Instrument instance, and returns the number of ServiceInfo
instances stored in the array list.

Step 4: The getInstrumentIndexAndName() method of the InstrumentList instance, which returns a string containing the index of 
the instrument and the name, is called. 

Step 5: The getIndexAndService() method of the InstrumentList instance is called, which in turn calls the getIndexAndService()
method of the relevant Instrument instance stored in the InstrumentList instance used for the program. Both methods return the 
index of the required servicing and the brief description of the servicing. The getIndexAndService() method of the Instrument
instance calls the getServiceInfo() method on the relevant service to obtain the brief description of the servicing. 

Step 6: The serviceAdded() method of the Ui class, which prints a message notifying the user that the servicing information has
been added, is then called.

==== Viewing the list of servicing done for a particular instrument

Step 1: The user will type in the command `instrument view services <instrument index>`. The getInstrumentServiceInfo() method from 
the InstrumentList class is called, which in turn calls the getServiceInfos() method of the relevant Instrument instance stored in 
the array list of Instruments in the InstrumentList instance. Both methods return the list of servicing done to the relevant
instrument. The getServiceInfos() function iterates through the stored list of ServiceInfo instances and calls getServiceInfo() on
all the ServieInfo instances to obtain the descriptions of the servicings.

Step 2: The getInstrumentIndexAndName() method of the InstrumentList instance, which returns a string containing the index of 
the instrument and the name, is called. 

Step 3: The printServices() method from the Ui class is then called, which prints out the list of servicing stored in a particular
Instrument instance.

==== Sequence diagram
The following sequence diagram shows how the view services functionality works.
====
image::getServicesInstrumentSequenceDiagram.png[width = 100%]
====

==== Why it is implemented this way
The implementation makes use of three classes, which are InstrumentList, Instrument and ServiceInfo. This allows for easier 
testing as each of the classes represent a different component of the functionality. The InstrumentList instance stores an array 
list of Instrument instances, an Instrument instance stores an array list of ServiceInfo instances.


== Documentation
We use asciidoc for writing documentation.
[NOTE]
We chose asciidoc over Markdown because asciidoc, although a bit more complex than Markdown, provides more flexibility
in formatting.

== Testing
The testing for our application is done through Junit tests (also viable to run these through gradle) and
manual testing, covered in <<Instructions for Manual Testing, Appendix E: Instructions for manual testing>>

=== Junit testing
. IntelliJ: Simply right click the src/test/java directory and select `Run 'Tests in 'seedu.duke...'` or right
click the individual test class you wish to run, and select `Run 'BudgetTest'` for example when testing
individual components. This can also be done through the Gradle sidebar (double click the corresponding test
under `run configurations`).
. Command prompt: Simply type the command `gradlew clean test`

== Dev Ops
For build automation, we chose to use gradle, allowing for a more convenient process when running tests and
checking for coding standard violations. Here are some of the gradle tasks that are essential to the
development of the application.

NOTE: For all the following commands, it is possible to run them through the IntelliJ IDE using the gradle
task bar. The tasks on the task bar are identical in name to the command line tasks, so the following
information is still relevant regarding their functions.

=== How to run gradle commands
Use the command `gradlew <taskname>`

NOTE: Different tasks can be run at the same time by using a format such as
`gradlew <task1> <task2>...`

WARNING: For Mac users, you will need to add a `./` prefix before the command. For example,
`./gradlew run`

=== Building a jar file
The command `shadowJar` will build a jar file using the current source code and store it under
the #build/libs# directory.

=== Clean
The command `gradlew clean` will remove the buildDir folder, thus removing everything including leftover
files from previous builds which are no longer necessary.

WARNING: While running a task, Gradle checks if it is actually necessary to carry out the procedure by default.
For example, Gradle will not rebuild the jar file if source code has not changed since the last time a jar file
was packaged.

In order to force gradle to execute the task, the `clean` command can be used. For instance,
`gradlew clean shadowJar` will force a new jar file to be built.

=== Running the application

==== Run as per normal:
The command `gradlew run` will build and run the application

==== Run as jar file:
The command `gradlew runShadow` will build the project as a jar file, and then run it.

=== Checkstyle
Using the command `checkstyleMain` will check for style violations in the *main* source code.
Using the command `checkstyleTest` will check for style violations in the *test* source code.

NOTE: The checkstyle settings can be configured by editing the `config/checkstyle/checkstyle.xml`
file.

.. Notice earlier that the concert entry events have an extra field at the end. This denotes
the cost of the concert to be added.
.. Attempting to add two concerts to the same month that exceeds the stipulated budget
(set at $50) will result in a message telling the user so, and that the operation has been
cancelled. Try `concert NewConcert/1-11-2019 1400 1600/60` for example.

. The user command `budget MM-yyyy` will result in the program displaying the costs
of all concerts in the month denoted by MM-yyyy. +
e.g `budget 11-2019` will display the costs for the month of November 2019.
